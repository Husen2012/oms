## 🎯 **Proposed Shipping Companies Accounting System**

### **1. Shipping Companies Master Data**

```javascript
const shippingCompanies = [
    {
        id: 'DHL001',
        name: 'DHL Express',
        code: 'DHL',
        type: 'international_express',
        accountNumber: '2010-001', // Accounts Payable sub-account
        contactInfo: {
            email: 'billing@dhl.com',
            phone: '+1-800-CALL-DHL',
            website: 'www.dhl.com'
        },
        paymentTerms: {
            terms: 'net30', // Net 30 days
            creditLimit: 50000,
            currency: 'USD'
        },
        services: [
            {
                serviceCode: 'EXPRESS_WORLDWIDE',
                serviceName: 'DHL Express Worldwide',
                baseRate: 25.00,
                weightRate: 8.50, // per kg
                fuelSurcharge: 0.15 // 15%
            },
            {
                serviceCode: 'EXPRESS_12',
                serviceName: 'DHL Express 12:00',
                baseRate: 35.00,
                weightRate: 12.00,
                fuelSurcharge: 0.15
            }
        ],
        accountingSettings: {
            defaultExpenseAccount: '6010-001', // Shipping Expenses - DHL
            taxId: 'DHL-TAX-123',
            preferredCurrency: 'USD',
            invoiceFrequency: 'monthly' // weekly, monthly, per_shipment
        }
    },
    {
        id: 'FEDEX001',
        name: 'FedEx Corporation',
        code: 'FEDEX',
        type: 'international_express',
        accountNumber: '2010-002',
        // ... similar structure
    }
    // ... other carriers
];
```

### **2. Enhanced Chart of Accounts for Shipping**

```javascript
const shippingAccountsStructure = {
    // Assets
    '1150': 'Shipping Deposits', // Prepaid shipping accounts
    '1160': 'Shipping Receivables', // Outstanding shipping charges to customers
    
    // Liabilities  
    '2010-001': 'Accounts Payable - DHL',
    '2010-002': 'Accounts Payable - FedEx', 
    '2010-003': 'Accounts Payable - UPS',
    '2010-004': 'Accounts Payable - China Post',
    '2010-005': 'Accounts Payable - SF Express',
    '2010-006': 'Accounts Payable - Aramex',
    '2010-007': 'Accounts Payable - EMS',
    '2010-008': 'Accounts Payable - Sea Freight',
    '2010-009': 'Accounts Payable - Air Freight',
    '2020-001': 'Accrued Shipping Expenses',
    
    // Revenue
    '4030-001': 'Shipping Revenue - Air',
    '4030-002': 'Shipping Revenue - Sea', 
    '4030-003': 'Shipping Revenue - Express',
    '4030-004': 'Shipping Revenue - Standard',
    
    // Expenses
    '6010-001': 'Shipping Expenses - DHL',
    '6010-002': 'Shipping Expenses - FedEx',
    '6010-003': 'Shipping Expenses - UPS', 
    '6010-004': 'Shipping Expenses - China Post',
    '6010-005': 'Shipping Expenses - SF Express',
    '6010-006': 'Shipping Expenses - Aramex',
    '6010-007': 'Shipping Expenses - EMS',
    '6010-008': 'Shipping Expenses - Sea Freight',
    '6010-009': 'Shipping Expenses - Air Freight',
    '6011': 'Fuel Surcharges',
    '6012': 'Customs and Duties',
    '6013': 'Insurance - Shipping',
    '6014': 'Packaging Materials',
    '6015': 'Warehouse Handling Fees'
};
```

### **3. Shipping Transaction Recording System**

```javascript
// When creating a shipment
function recordShipmentTransaction(shipment) {
    const shippingCompany = getShippingCompany(shipment.carrierId);
    const journalEntry = new JournalEntry(
        shipment.shipDate,
        `Shipment ${shipment.id} via ${shippingCompany.name}`,
        shipment.id
    );
    
    // Record shipping expense (what we pay to carrier)
    journalEntry.addDebit(
        shippingCompany.accountingSettings.defaultExpenseAccount,
        shipment.actualShippingCost,
        `Shipping cost for ${shipment.id}`
    );
    
    // Record accounts payable to shipping company
    journalEntry.addCredit(
        shippingCompany.accountNumber,
        shipment.actualShippingCost,
        `Amount owed to ${shippingCompany.name}`
    );
    
    // Record shipping revenue (what customer pays us)
    if (shipment.customerShippingCharge > 0) {
        const revenueAccount = getShippingRevenueAccount(shipment.serviceType);
        
        journalEntry.addDebit(
            '1160', // Shipping Receivables
            shipment.customerShippingCharge,
            `Shipping charge to customer for ${shipment.id}`
        );
        
        journalEntry.addCredit(
            revenueAccount,
            shipment.customerShippingCharge,
            `Shipping revenue for ${shipment.id}`
        );
    }
    
    return postJournalEntry(journalEntry);
}

// When paying shipping company invoice
function recordShippingPayment(payment) {
    const journalEntry = new JournalEntry(
        payment.paymentDate,
        `Payment to ${payment.shippingCompanyName}`,
        payment.referenceNumber
    );
    
    // Reduce accounts payable
    journalEntry.addDebit(
        payment.shippingCompany.accountNumber,
        payment.amount,
        `Payment to ${payment.shippingCompanyName}`
    );
    
    // Reduce cash
    journalEntry.addCredit(
        '1010', // Cash account
        payment.amount,
        `Payment via ${payment.paymentMethod}`
    );
    
    return postJournalEntry(journalEntry);
}
```

### **4. Shipping Companies Management Interface**

```javascript
// Shipping Companies CRUD operations
function createShippingCompany(companyData) {
    const newCompany = {
        id: generateShippingCompanyId(),
        ...companyData,
        createdDate: new Date().toISOString(),
        status: 'active',
        totalShipments: 0,
        totalSpent: 0,
        averageCost: 0,
        lastShipmentDate: null
    };
    
    shippingCompanies.push(newCompany);
    saveShippingCompaniesToStorage();
    
    return newCompany;
}

function updateShippingCompanyRates(companyId, newRates) {
    const company = shippingCompanies.find(c => c.id === companyId);
    if (company) {
        company.services = newRates;
        company.lastUpdated = new Date().toISOString();
        saveShippingCompaniesToStorage();
    }
}

function getShippingCompanyPerformance(companyId, startDate, endDate) {
    const shipments = getShipmentsByCarrier(companyId, startDate, endDate);
    
    return {
        totalShipments: shipments.length,
        totalCost: shipments.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.actualShippingCost, 0),
        averageCost: shipments.length > 0 ? 
            shipments.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.actualShippingCost, 0) / shipments.length : 0,
        onTimeDeliveryRate: calculateOnTimeRate(shipments),
        costPerKg: calculateCostPerKg(shipments),
        profitMargin: calculateShippingProfitMargin(shipments)
    };
}
```

### **5. Financial Reporting for Shipping**

```javascript
// Shipping Profit & Loss Report
function generateShippingPLReport(startDate, endDate) {
    const shippingRevenue = {
        airShipping: getAccountBalance('4030-001', startDate, endDate),
        seaShipping: getAccountBalance('4030-002', startDate, endDate),
        expressShipping: getAccountBalance('4030-003', startDate, endDate),
        standardShipping: getAccountBalance('4030-004', startDate, endDate)
    };
    
    const shippingExpenses = {
        dhlExpenses: getAccountBalance('6010-001', startDate, endDate),
        fedexExpenses: getAccountBalance('6010-002', startDate, endDate),
        upsExpenses: getAccountBalance('6010-003', startDate, endDate),
        chinaPostExpenses: getAccountBalance('6010-004', startDate, endDate),
        // ... other carriers
        fuelSurcharges: getAccountBalance('6011', startDate, endDate),
        customsDuties: getAccountBalance('6012', startDate, endDate),
        shippingInsurance: getAccountBalance('6013', startDate, endDate)
    };
    
    const totalRevenue = Object.values(shippingRevenue).reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
    const totalExpenses = Object.values(shippingExpenses).reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
    const netShippingProfit = totalRevenue - totalExpenses;
    const profitMargin = totalRevenue > 0 ? (netShippingProfit / totalRevenue) * 100 : 0;
    
    return {
        revenue: shippingRevenue,
        totalRevenue,
        expenses: shippingExpenses,
        totalExpenses,
        netShippingProfit,
        profitMargin,
        period: { startDate, endDate }
    };
}

// Carrier Performance Report
function generateCarrierPerformanceReport(startDate, endDate) {
    const carrierPerformance = shippingCompanies.map(carrier => {
        const performance = getShippingCompanyPerformance(carrier.id, startDate, endDate);
        return {
            carrierId: carrier.id,
            carrierName: carrier.name,
            ...performance,
            costEfficiency: performance.averageCost > 0 ? 
                (performance.totalCost / performance.totalShipments) : 0,
            revenueGenerated: getCarrierRevenueGenerated(carrier.id, startDate, endDate)
        };
    });
    
    return carrierPerformance.sort((a, b) => b.profitMargin - a.profitMargin);
}
```
